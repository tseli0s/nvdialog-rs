//! This crate offers high level, low overhead bindings to NvDialog for Rust. It's the successor of
//! the [`nvdialog`](https://crates.io/crates/nvdialog) crate which provided system bindings to NvDialog
//! using `libloading`.
//! 
//! # Safety
//! The crate tries to imitate Rust's compile time checks with NvDialog, to ensure that safety is
//! present within your code. This includes adding mutable references when an FFI call changes something
//! instead of plain references (Which aren't checked anyways).
//! 
//! When it comes to threads, NvDialog's rules don't change here either: The dialogs must be created and used
//! within the same thread. Creating dialogs from secondary threads is not supported officially.
//! 
//! 
//! # Example dialog:
//! ```rust
//! /* Importing types */
//! extern crate nvdialog_rs;
//! use nvdialog_rs::DialogBox;
//! use nvdialog_rs::DialogType;
//! 
//! /* Initialize the library. This corresponds to 'nvd_init' */
//! nvdialog_rs::init(String::new());
//!
//! /* Creating the dialog box. */
//! let dialog_box = DialogBox::new(
//!        "Hello from Rust!", /* Title of the dialog */
//!        /* Message of the dialog */
//!        "This dialog has been created using Rust and NvDialog bindings to the language.",
//!        /* See documentation for more */
//!        DialogType::Simple
//! );
//!
//! /* Showing the dialog box. */
//! dialog_box.show();
//! ```

/// On success (0 returned from `nvd_init`), `Ok(())` is returned. Otherwise, an `Err` with the error
/// code returned from NvDialog is returned.
/// # Examples:
/// ```rust
/// fn main() {
///     nvdialog_rs::init(String::new())
///         .expect("failed to initialize NvDialog");
/// }
